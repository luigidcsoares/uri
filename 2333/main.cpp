// Note that this problem is quite similar to finding the maximum subarray sum,
// but in a circular list since the last element is adjacent to the first.
//
// For instance, given the circular property, we can have a solution as
// follows:
// - A = [a1, a2, ..., an] is the input of size n.
// - S = [ai, ..., an, a1, ..., ai-1] is the solution.
//
// The most ingenuous solution would be to run he maximum subarray sum
// algorithm for each possible starting point. This approach would run in
// Theta(nÂ²). We can try to do better, though. We need to run the maximum
// subarray algorithm for different intial elements, but for how many? Note
// that there exists an inverse problem A' = {a * -1 | a in A}. We can search
// for the maximum subarray in A' (this time considering A as a simple list,
// not circular). Let s' be the solution for A'. If you consider A as an array
// (without the circular property), then s' A' is the worse solution for A. If
// s' is 0, there is no such worst solution; thus, we can just run the maximum
// subarray for A a single time. Otherwise, we run the maximum subarray for A,
// starting at the first element, and also run for A but starting at the first
// element right after s'. The best solution will be the max between the two.
